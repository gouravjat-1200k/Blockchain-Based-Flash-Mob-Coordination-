I've created a comprehensive Solidity project for Blockchain-Based Flash Mob Coordination. Here's what I've delivered:
📁 Project Structure
Blockchain-Based Flash Mob Coordination/

Project.sol - Main smart contract
README.md - Complete documentation

🔧 Smart Contract Features
Core Functions:

createFlashMob() - Organizers create flash mob events with scheduled reveal times
joinFlashMob() - Participants register for events before location is revealed
revealLocation() - Organizers reveal the location at the specified time

Additional Helper Functions:

confirmParticipation() - Participants confirm attendance after reveal
getFlashMobDetails() - Query event information
isParticipant() / hasConfirmedParticipation() - Check participation status
Event tracking for organizers and participants

🎯 Key Highlights
✅ Time-based reveal mechanism - Locations stay hidden until reveal time
✅ Access control - Only organizers can reveal locations
✅ Transparent participation - All joins/confirmations recorded on-chain
✅ Event validation - Ensures logical time sequences and prevents duplicates
✅ Comprehensive event tracking - Query events by organizer or participant
The README includes detailed project vision, features, and extensive future scope covering tokenization, NFTs, cross-chain deployment, and even AR/VR integration!
